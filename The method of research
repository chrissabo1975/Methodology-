📘 Origins in Ethnomethodology

This research program originates in Harold Garfinkel’s ethnomethodology — the study of how social order is produced through situated, recursive practices. Under Dr. Rawls’ mentorship, I learned to see structure not as given, but as an emergent accomplishment of iterative, reflexive moves.

I asked: If social reality is built through recursive practices, could physical reality be built the same way?

🧩 From Social Order to Universal Order: The Toy Universe

Using the ethnomethodological lens, I constructed a toy universe based on the most fundamental recursive process I could identify: cell mitosis.

The method:

1. Start with a minimal recursive unit (split → tension → failed merge → scar → decay).
2. Apply ethnomethodology’s “breaching experiments” — intentionally disrupt steps to see what preserves order.
3. Fill gaps with principles from opposing disciplines (biology → physics → mathematics → sociology).
4. Observe emergent patterns across scales.

Unexpectedly, the toy universe held. It wasn’t just a metaphor — it was a generative model that could be “plugged and played” across domains.

🎮 The Cheat Code Emerges

What began as a sociological thought experiment revealed a recursive architecture so consistent it functioned as a cheat code:

· In geometry, it produces the golden ratio (φ).
· In quantum mechanics, it reproduces Bell inequality violation (CHSH = 2√2).
· In biology, it models mitosis, dreaming, and decay.
· In social theory, it explains ritual, conflict, and memory.

The cheat code isn’t a theory of everything — it’s a method for seeing how everything might be built from the same moves.

🔬 This Repository: An Open Toolkit

Here you’ll find:

· prime_move_loop/ – Python implementations of the core recursive loop.
· simulations/ – Quantum entanglement (CHSH), geometric φ-emergence, cellular automata.
· datasets/ – Parameter sweeps and empirical tests.
· papers/ – Drafts and preprints linking ethnomethodology to physical models.
· visualizations/ – How the loop manifests across disciplines.

This is not a finished theory — it’s an open methodological experiment in cross-disciplinary pattern recognition.

🎯 Research Questions

1. Can a recursion derived from social interaction generate valid physical models?
2. Does the “scar” concept provide a unified account of entropy, memory, and entanglement?
3. Is the golden ratio a fixed point of universal recursion?
4. Can this method predict new patterns in existing data?

🧠 Why Sociology? Why Ethnomethodology?

Sociology — especially the Garfinkel–Rawls tradition — trains one to see order-as-process.
When you stop assuming order and start watching it get made, you begin to recognize the same making-patterns in cells, particles, dreams, and symbols.

This project is what happens when you take that sociological lens and point it at reality itself.
